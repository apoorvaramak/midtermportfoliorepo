            About Me
          </h1>
          <p>
            I am a designer, programmer, and content creator from the suburbs of Chicago now studying as a freshman in Interactive Media Arts at New York University. I’ve studied both digital and traditional mediums of art but am now focusing on the digital aspects. I also graduated from the Flatiron School fullstack developer bootcamp.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I’ve used many different softwares and websites for creating infographics, videos, webpages, drawings, and animations. These were for a variety of purposes: personal, school, and my internship at Zinda.xyz. I learned how to use Photoshop, Premiere Pro, AfterEffects, Illustrator, Audition, Powtoon, Canva, and Wordpress. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I’m also involved in other arts, such as playing the cello, which I play in the NYU community orchestra, recitals, and for the patrons of the memory unit in the Garlands of Barrington. I also bake and decorate many desserts for birthdays and other special occasions.
