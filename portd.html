            This is the final project I created for the fullstack development bootcamp 
            at the Flatiron School. This is a website that is for reviewing video games. 
            You can create an account, login, add games to your library, leave reviews for 
            games, and see other peopleâ€™s profiles as well. It is hosted on Heroku here. 
            I also created a pitch for it as well, which is linked.
