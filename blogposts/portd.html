            This is the final project I created for the fullstack development bootcamp 
            at the Flatiron School. This is a website that is for reviewing video games. 
            You can create an account, login, add games to your library, leave reviews for 
            games, and see other peopleâ€™s profiles as well. It is hosted on Heroku <a href= "https://fathomless-ridge-61332.herokuapp.com/">here</a>. 
            I also created a pitch for it as well, which is <a href = "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-d7jGtVa7f8JKpic7qztxMYqTzxKHWUomiBphubh-v0/edit?usp=sharing">linked</a>.
