            This is a prototype that I helped create for a man, Michael, 
            that has a disability where his fine motor skills have been damaged. 
            He has trouble opening things that turn to open, like jars and door 
            knobs. So, my partners and I created this prototype that would help 
            alleviate these issues for him. <a href = "https://www.apoorvarama.com/blog/2020/3/15/michaels-prototype">Here</a> 
            is a link to my blog post about it!
