            This is a project that I created for Machine Learning for the Arts, a class I took. 
            I created this because I am interested in accessibility and how machine learning can 
            really help in this field. This is a game that can be played on p5 just by moving your
            nose from side to side to hit notes, similar to something like rock band or guitar hero.
            I made this accessible by making it so that anyone that can turn their head just a little 
            to each side is able to play this. <a href = "https://youtu.be/XJSQVZYDLbw">Here</a> is a demonstration, 
            and <a href= "https://editor.p5js.org/aramakrishnan/sketches/tjsVl7-cn">here</a> is how you can play it yourself.
