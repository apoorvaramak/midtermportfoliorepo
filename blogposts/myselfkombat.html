            In this video, I simulated the gameplay of a videogame that I 
            created to parody the fighting game Mortal Kombat. This was a 
            fun and whimsical way to look at dealing with stress using 
            mindfulness techniques. <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONJSn0BNB08">Here</a> is the link to the video and 
            <a href = "https://www.apoorvarama.com/blog/2019/10/22/myself-kombat">here</a> 
            is the link to a blog post with more about it.
