            For my internship at Zinda, I helped design a new layout for the 
            Journyz pages. I created these mockups using Balsamiq. I communicated 
            with people that use the app and seeing what they thought could make 
            it better and added my own vision, integrating everything into designs 
            that I think are cleaner and more user friendly for Journyz users.
